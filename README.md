# The sus/amogus checker

Written in Python 3, this program will let you check if the everyday object is sus or not.

Just download and run the .py file [(or head to the Replit page)](https://replit.com/@ninjasmosa/The-susamogus-checker) and answer a series of questions to see if the object is sus or if you've simply gone crazy.
